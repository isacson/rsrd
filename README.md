WOLA Regional Security Research Database

I work at the Washington Office on Latin America, where I monitor the United States’ military relationship with Latin America. We have great gaps in our knowledge of what lies at the intersection of foreign policy, the U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, human rights, drug policy, and civil-military relations in Latin America. At the same time, we’ve got an overload of information from official and unofficial sources, and dozens of people whom we can ask for more. How can we figure out what we know, what we need to know, how to get it, and what to prioritize?
With that in mind, this summer I’ve been building a “database of everything.”
Well, not really. But it’s pretty ambitious, and it’s scratching some longtime itches. For now, I’m calling it the “WOLA Regional Security Research Database.” (RSRD)
There is a lot to keep track of, and I couldn’t find any off-the-shelf software that let me do it. The best answer I’ve come up with was to build something myself. It’s sitting at www.defenseassistance.org, which is a domain I’ve long used for projects in development. What’s there isn’t pretty—I’m a poor designer—but hopefully it’s easy to use.
It’s a mySQL database with PHP pages pulling information out of it. These pages use a lot of javascript to make them more convenient to use in a browser. Since it's browser-based, it’s easy to share parts of the RSRD with the public. So anyone who’s interested in our note-taking from official and published sources (it must be millions of people, right?) will be able to see it all online.
I’ve got a long way to go until the “database of everything” is finished, but there’s enough done that it’s functional. Take it for a spin. Let me know if it breaks. Watch it grow. And I look forward to posting more frequently in the fall.
